A classic Todo List project implemented using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

Just for practice!

### Resources

- [react-move](https://github.com/react-tools/react-move): A more usable animation library for React in comparison with [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion), at least from my perspective
- [react-particles-js](https://github.com/Wufe/react-particles-js): A good React wrapper for the popular [particles.js library](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
- A [good guide](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/) on how to implement SVG line animation by yourself.
- A [good guide](https://codepen.io/theigmo87/pen/cwHyK) on how to implement a pretty checkbox animation.
